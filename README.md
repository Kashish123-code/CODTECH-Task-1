# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to implement a variety of AI models and evaluate their performance using key metrics. This includes comparing models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other domain-specific metrics. The project aims to determine which model performs best for the given dataset and problem type.

# Key Activities of Model Evaluation and Comparison for AI Models
**Problem Definition:** The project will focus on a particular problem domain, such as classification, regression, or clustering. The choice of problem will dictate the models and evaluation metrics used.

**Dataset:** A well-defined dataset will be selected for training and testing the models. The dataset should be diverse and reflect real-world conditions to ensure robust model performance.

**AI Models:** Multiple AI models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, and Decision Trees, will be implemented and compared.

**Evaluation Metrics:** The models will be evaluated using appropriate metrics, depending on whether the problem is classification, regression, or clustering.<br />
For classification tasks: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.<br />
For regression tasks: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared, etc.<br/>
For clustering tasks: Silhouette Score, Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), etc.
